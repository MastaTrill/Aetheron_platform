## 🚨 COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

❌ **Posting once and giving up** → Post daily for 30 days minimum
❌ **Spamming Telegram groups** → Genuine engagement only
❌ **Ignoring community questions** → Reply to ALL within 1 hour
❌ **No tracking** → Use daily checklist
❌ **Buying followers** → Ruins credibility, waste of money
❌ **Unrealistic promises** → Honesty builds trust
❌ **Spending before testing** → Free first, paid second
❌ **Doing everything alone** → Hire help or find partners
❌ **Forgetting existing users** → Engage current users, not just new
❌ **No follow-up** → Follow up on listings, investors, partners
