### SECTION 3: Contracts & Addresses

**Q: Contract Address (REQUIRED)**
```
0xAb5ae0D8f569d7c2B27574319b864a5bA6F9671e
```

**Q: Block Explorer URL**
```
https://polygonscan.com/token/0xAb5ae0D8f569d7c2B27574319b864a5bA6F9671e
```

**Q: Is the contract verified on PolygonScan?**
```
Yes
```

**Q: Decimals**
```
18
```

**Q: Total Supply**
```
1000000000
```

**Q: Circulating Supply** (at time of application)
```
[Calculate: Total Supply minus locked/staked tokens]
Example: 850000000 (85% circulating)
```

**Q: CMC Methodology (How to calculate circulating supply)**
```
Circulating Supply = Total Supply - Tokens locked in staking contracts

Method:
1. Query total token supply: 1,000,000,000 AETH
2. Query staking contract balances for locked tokens
3. Subtract locked tokens from total supply
4. Update: Tokens unlock from staking gradually over time

Public verification:
All staking contracts are viewable on PolygonScan. Community can independently verify circulating supply calculations.

Auto-update API (if available):
We can provide an API endpoint that returns real-time circulating supply based on on-chain data.
