# 🔐 Contract Ownership Transfer Guide

## 📋 Overview

This guide will help you transfer ownership of your Aetheron smart contracts from the old deployer wallet to your Coinbase wallet (`0x127C3a5A0922A0A952aDE71412E2DC651Aa7AF82`).

## ⚠️ Prerequisites

- **Private Key**: You need the private key of the current owner wallet (`0x8A3ad49656Bd07981C9CFc7aD826a808847c3452`)
- **MATIC**: ~0.01 MATIC for gas fees
- **Node.js**: Installed on your system

---

## 🚀 Step 1: Transfer Ownership

### Option A: Automated Script (Recommended)

1. **Set your private key as environment variable:**

   ```bash
   # Windows PowerShell
   $env:PRIVATE_KEY = "0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE"

   # Linux/Mac
   export PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE
   ```

2. **Run the transfer script:**
   ```bash
   cd "c:\Users\willi\OneDrive\Desktop\Aetheron platform\Aetheron_platform-1"
   node transfer-ownership.js
   ```

### Option B: Manual Transfer via PolygonScan

#### Transfer AETH Contract Ownership:

1. Go to [AETH Contract on PolygonScan](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x44F9c15816bCe5d6691448F60DAD50355ABa40b5)
2. Click **"Contract"** → **"Write Contract"** → **"Connect to Web3"**
3. Connect your current owner wallet
4. Find `transferOwnership` function
5. Enter: `0x127C3a5A0922A0A952aDE71412E2DC651Aa7AF82`
6. Click **"Write"** and confirm the transaction

#### Transfer Staking Contract Ownership:

1. Go to [Staking Contract on PolygonScan](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xA39D2334567f3142312F7Abfc63aa3E8Eabd56e7)
2. Repeat steps 2-6 above

## 🔍 Step 2: Verify Ownership

### Automated Verification:

```bash
cd "c:\Users\willi\OneDrive\Desktop\Aetheron platform\Aetheron_platform-1"
node verify-ownership.js
```

This will check:

- ✅ AETH contract owner
- ✅ Staking contract owner
- ✅ Contract states (paused, taxes, etc.)

### Manual Verification:

1. Go to [AETH Contract on PolygonScan](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x44F9c15816bCe5d6691448F60DAD50355ABa40b5)
2. Click **"Contract"** → **"Read Contract"**
3. Call `owner()` function - should return `0x127C3a5A0922A0A952aDE71412E2DC651Aa7AF82`

---

## 🧪 Step 3: Test Admin Functions

### Automated Testing (Requires Private Key):

```bash
# Set your Coinbase wallet private key
$env:PRIVATE_KEY = "0xYOUR_COINBASE_PRIVATE_KEY"

# Run admin function tests
node verify-ownership.js
```

This will test:

- ✅ Ownership verification
- ✅ Pause/unpause functions
- ✅ Tax update functions
- ✅ Emergency controls

### Manual Testing via Frontend:

1. Open your deployed platform
2. Connect with your Coinbase wallet
3. Try admin functions in the dashboard:
   - Update taxes
   - Pause/unpause trading
   - Emergency withdraw

---

## 📝 Step 4: Update Documentation

### Files Already Updated:

- ✅ `CONTRACT_ADDRESSES.md`
- ✅ `index.js` & `index.min.js`
- ✅ `Scripts/deploy.js`
- ✅ `smart-contract/deployment-info.json`

### Additional Updates Needed:

1. **Update any marketing materials** that reference the old owner address
2. **Update investor documents** if applicable
3. **Update README.md** if it contains old addresses

---

## 🔐 Security Checklist
