Hey r/[subreddit],

I wanted to share a DeFi staking platform I've been working on called **Aetheron**.

**What makes it different:**
• Built on Polygon (99% cheaper than Ethereum)
• Three staking pools: 8%, 12%, 18% APY
• Real-time analytics dashboard (fully transparent)
• Interactive calculator to project earnings
• Mobile-optimized experience
• Verified smart contracts

**Why I built it:**
After paying $100+ in Ethereum gas fees to stake $500, I realized DeFi needs to be more accessible. So I built Aetheron on Polygon where fees are $0.01.
