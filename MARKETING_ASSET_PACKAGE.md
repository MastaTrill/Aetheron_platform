FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Aetheron Platform Launches on Polygon: High-Yield DeFi Staking with $0.01 Fees

[City, Date] — Aetheron, a next-generation decentralized finance (DeFi) staking platform, today announced its official launch on Polygon mainnet, offering retail investors access to 8-18% APY with industry-low transaction costs.

Key Highlights:
• Three flexible staking pools (7, 30, 90-day lock periods)
• Transaction fees as low as $0.01 (99% cheaper than Ethereum Layer 1)
• Real-time analytics dashboard for full transparency
• Interactive earnings calculator for informed decisions
• Mobile-optimized experience for on-the-go staking

"DeFi should be accessible to everyone, not just whales who can afford $50+ gas fees," said [Your Name], Founder of Aetheron. "By building on Polygon, we've created a platform where a $100 investment makes as much sense as a $100,000 one."

Technical Innovation:
Aetheron's smart contracts are verified on Polygonscan and built using OpenZeppelin security standards. The platform has undergone 68 comprehensive tests and maintains full transparency with open-source code available on GitHub.

Tokenomics:
The AETH token has a fixed supply of 1 billion, with 20% (200M) allocated to staking rewards. A deflationary mechanism through trading fee buybacks ensures long-term value appreciation.

Availability:
Aetheron is live now at https://aetheronplatform.github.io. Users need a MetaMask wallet and access to Polygon network to start staking.

About Aetheron:
Aetheron is a DeFi staking platform built on Polygon that combines high yield, low fees, and transparent analytics. The project aims to democratize access to institutional-grade DeFi returns.
