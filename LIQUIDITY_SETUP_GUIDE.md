# 🌊 Aetheron Liquidity Setup Guide

## Critical: Add Liquidity to Launch AETH Token

Your token is deployed but has **ZERO liquidity**. Nobody can trade until you create a liquidity pool.

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

- [ ] MetaMask wallet connected to Polygon
- [ ] AETH tokens in your wallet
- [ ] USDC or MATIC for pairing
- [ ] Extra MATIC for gas fees (~0.1 MATIC)

---

## 🎯 Step 1: Decide Your Liquidity Amount

### Recommended Starting Liquidity

**Option A: Small Launch (Testing)**
- 100,000 AETH + $100 USDC
- Creates initial price: ~$0.001 per AETH
- Market cap: ~$1,000

**Option B: Medium Launch (Recommended)**
- 1,000,000 AETH + $1,000 USDC
- Creates initial price: ~$0.001 per AETH
- Market cap: ~$1,000

**Option C: Strong Launch**
- 10,000,000 AETH + $10,000 USDC
- Creates initial price: ~$0.001 per AETH
- Market cap: ~$10,000

**Your choice determines the initial price!**

## 📊 Step 3: Verify Liquidity

1. Go to: https://quickswap.exchange/#/swap
2. Select AETH in the swap interface
3. You should now see a price displayed!
4. Try swapping a small amount to test

### Check on PolygonScan

1. Go to: https://polygonscan.com/token/0xAb5ae0D8f569d7c2B27574319b864a5bA6F9671e
2. Look for "DEX Trades" or "Holders" section
3. Should show QuickSwap pair address

---

## 💰 Step 4: Calculate Initial Market Cap

```
Example with 1M AETH + 1000 USDC:
- Price per AETH = 1000 / 1,000,000 = $0.001
- Total Supply = 1,000,000,000 AETH
- Market Cap = 1B × $0.001 = $1,000,000

This is your starting market cap!
```

## ⚠️ Important Warnings

### Lock Your Liquidity (Recommended)

To build trust, consider locking liquidity for 3-12 months:
- Use: https://mudra.website/ or similar
- Prevents "rug pull" concerns
- Increases investor confidence

### Don't Remove Liquidity

- Removing liquidity kills trading
- Token becomes "dead"
- Destroys investor confidence

### Start Conservative

- You can always ADD more liquidity
- You can't easily reduce without impacting price
- Better to start smaller and grow

---

## 🎯 After Adding Liquidity

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Update Your Website**
   - Add "Buy on QuickSwap" button
   - Link to: `https://quickswap.exchange/#/swap?outputCurrency=0xAb5ae0D8f569d7c2B27574319b864a5bA6F9671e`

2. **Test Everything**
   - Buy small amount on QuickSwap
   - Verify it works
   - Check price updates on your dashboard

3. **Announce to Community**
   - "🎉 AETH is now live on QuickSwap!"
   - Share trading link
   - Show liquidity proof

4. **Submit to Aggregators**
   - CoinGecko: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/new
   - CoinMarketCap: https://coinmarketcap.com/request/
   - DexTools: https://www.dextools.io/
   - Both require liquidity FIRST
